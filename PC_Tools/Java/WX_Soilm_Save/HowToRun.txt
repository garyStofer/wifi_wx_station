First Install Java Runtime environment (JRE) on the computer. If it's a Windows XP computer you will get 
an notice that Java 8 is not actively supported any more. You can disregard the message and install it anyway. 

The application is WXSoilSave.jar and requires two command line arguments, one for the IP address the other
for the sample interval (optional, default 12 mins).

java -jar WXSoilSave.jar -ip 192.168.1.201 -i 12 

	Mandatory argument "-ip  xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx" defines the address of the WX station 
	Optional argument "-i nn" sets the interval in minutes for polling of that station.
	

The file "run.cmd" is a batch file that can be customized for your particular requirements. 
Make a copy each of this file and change the IP addresses to match the addresses from the stations
and run each copy.

The output data file will be stored in the local folder and named according to the IP address of the
station sampled. 

You can stop the program by switching to the terminal window and close it or issue a Ctrl-C.
The application also terminates if the station is off and it times-out on the read.
