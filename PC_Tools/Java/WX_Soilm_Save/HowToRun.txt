The Java application is built in dist/WXSoilSave.jar. It can be started from a CMD command line window as  follows:

java -jar WXSoilSave.jar -ip 192.168.1.201 -i 12 

	Mandatory argument "-ip  xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx" defines the address of the WX station 
	Optional argument "-i nn" sets the interval in minutes the polling of that station happens
	
See also the Run.cmd file which calls the application and is click-able from the Windows file browser.	
edit run.cmd to suit.
