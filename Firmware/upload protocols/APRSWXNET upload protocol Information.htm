<h1>APRSWXNET</h1>
This page describes random bits of information about how I hooked my
weather
station up to APRSWXNET. I am CW0003 -- you can find my data at <a href="http://www.findu.com/cgi-bin/wxpage.cgi?call=CW0003&amp;last=120">findu.com</a>.
<p>
The basic idea is that you send a single record at regular intervals (I
currently do this every 10 minutes). However, do not send on 5 minute 
boundaries, or else send at an odd interval (e.g. 9 minutes 30 seconds).
 
There are significant problems with large numbers of sites all hitting 
the servers at the same time.
This record contains your identity
(CW number), location and the various readings. I believe in 'document
by example', so here goes:
</p>
<pre>CW0003&gt;APRS,TCPXX*:/241505z4220.45N/07128.59W_032/005g008t054r001p078P048h50b10245e1w<br></pre>

pressure as measured at your weatherstation. The pressure is adjusted 
according to altimeter rules -- i.e. the adjustment is purely based on 
station elevation and does not include temperature compensation.

      <td>The equipment you are using. This is the string that I use to 
identify my software. Please use something different. In particular, 
please include
      the version number of your software and the type of hardware 
sensors attached. For example: eMyWx123DVP -- MyWx version 1.2.3 with 
Davis Vantage Pro hardware. Being explicit here allows other 
      software to automatically determine the type of station software 
in use. It can also be used to encourage people to upgrade to the 
current version!
      Weather Display has a table of codes that cover most weather 
station types and it would be helpful to use the same codes.

<br>
Note that most fields are fixed width. This constraint means that use of C-like formatting
strings such as 'h%02d' is not really appropriate as they do not deal with out of range
values. In this particular case, it does not deal with the special case of 100% humidity either!

<p>The letters are all case
sensitive. The fields should be sent in the order that they appear in
the table above.
</p><p>Once you have formed this record, open a connection to port 14580 on
'cwop.aprs.net' and then send the following:
</p>
<pre>user CW0003 pass -1 vers linux-1wire 1.00<br></pre>
(substitute your CW number), followed by CR,LF (i.e. two
characters),
followed by your data record. Then disconnect. Also, it works best with
a three second delay between the USER command and the data packet. Also
wait three seconds after sending the data to close the connection.
<p>'cwop.aprs.net' is a DNS entry that rotates between the various CWOP servers. 
Do not hardcode any of the IP addresses!
</p>
<p>Information on this system can be found at <a href="http://www.wxqa.com/servers2use.html">Servers to use</a>.

<h2>Important Notes</h2>
If you do not have a particular sensor, then do not send default values
in that field. If the field can be omitted (as shown in the table
above), then please omit the field. If the field cannot be omitted,
then send '...' as the field value.
<p>Use of default values turns out to be a significant
issue with rainfall numbers. Most of the time, the value 'r000' is
valid (and likely). But once it starts to rain, the value is
dangerously wrong, and could prevent flood warnings from being issued.<br>
</p>
<h2>Debugging</h2>
The page <a href="http://www.wulfden.org/APRSQuery.shtml">APRS Search</a>
contains a bunch of useful search
boxes that you can enter your CW number into, and then see what data
has been received. Another useful site is <a href="http://206.97.61.103/wxall.html">APRSWXNET Maps and Status</a>.
<p>Other useful resources can be found from <a href="http://www.wxqa.com/index.html">Joining APRSWXNET</a>.
The actual <a href="ftp://ftp.tapr.org/aprssig/aprsspec/spec/aprs101/APRS101.pdf">APRS
protocol specification</a> is available in a PDF file. The information
presented above actually works,
and is somewhat different to what is in this document.

Data Quality Monitor</a> which will
send you email when your data goes 'bad'. For more information about
the quality checks, see <a href="http://www.wxqa.com/aprswxnetqc.html">APRSWXNET
