When flashing the Bootloader onto the device (with PIKIT) the entire device gets erased first -- Any application on the device gets wiped out
After Programming of the bootloader the device waits forever for the UART boot loader application from the PC to communicate.
When Program,ming an application with PICkit the Bootloader on the device gets wiped out.
When programming an application via the bootloader method the subsequent boot loader start up delay can be configured with variable BL_timeout in main.c
Programming a value of 0 in BL_timeout causes the bootloader to immediately go to the application main without waiting to connect to the PC.
The application gets loaded at 0xc00 instead of 0x200 as without a BL.

In order to end up with a device that contains the BL AND the application one has to first program the BL via PICkit and then load
the application via the Boot loader. The Boot loader program is specific to the mcu device type.


Bootloader PC Application:

Defaults to a specific COM port as configured in its .ini file. This is a problem with the CP210x USB/com device as each chip device
creates a unique COM port on the PC when initially connected as the enumerator is device serial number specific. You will
have to find the correct COM port each time from the machines hardware panel.
Baud rates above 57KB don't  to work.
There is no erase built into the program process. When re-programming with the bootloader make sure to click Erase first.
There is an annoying message stating that you will loose connection to the bootloader if you click run ... Very confusing to a user.
