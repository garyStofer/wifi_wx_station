<h2>Reboot In Progress...</h2>
<p><b>Your board is located at: 
<a  href="http://~rebootaddr~/">http://~rebootaddr~</a></b></p>
<p>Wait for the reboot process to complete.</p>
<p>On a LAN connection the browser will automatically reload in about 10 seconds.</p>
<p>On a WAN connection you need to reload manually after the connection request timed out.</p>
<h5>Note on Windows NETBIOS name caching</h5>
<p>
Windows caches the IP address associated with the NETBIOS names. If the device has changed it's IP address during the reboot a Windows computer will not connect
to the board via its name until the cache has been refreshed. The brute force method to reload the cache is to reboot the Windows computer.
 A slightly better option is to run the following command from a cmd window:<b> nbtstat -R</b>. </p>
<p>
Depending on the browser used, you might also need to clear the browser history after clearing the windows cache.
